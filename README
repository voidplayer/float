                      The Great Float 212 2.x alpha
                      =============================


Preamble
--------

Once upon a time, at one point and during a period, I was kinda obsesed with tanks. As a result I made 2 tank games. `Float 212` and `float 212 3D` in mode 7. They are probably lost in some old CD or lost forever sadly (I dont even own a CD driver anymore!)

This is a remake of one of them, therefore 2.x version :)

I had the silly idea of putting `The Great` in front of all of my games making a long saga of unifinished games. My `The Great` unifished saga if you will :)

I dont even remember where the 212 came from

They were made with Div Games Studio. A now sadly defunted engine and editor but with which I made some friends making games along the way and I managed to keep contact with some of them over the years!

After a few years of inactivity, I wanted to make some games again, and so I started looking at c++ and SFML... and before I knew it, I had some basic space shooter working... but then, it started to get complicated. I was going to need to build some kind of engine to be able to add complexity to the game, and reading some web article it hitted me... I wanted to make games, not engines...

This game was made to learn to use Godot Engine, a very promissing and free engine, where i hope i will dwell in the years coming
www.godoengine.com

more stuff is hopefully coming

Make Games, not Engines


Status
------

This game is heavily unfinished, but enough that I hope it will be useful to somebody else, since docs and examples are very much lacking for godot engine at this time (jun 2014). I hope this encourage more people to share their little games/demos code ;)

Graphics are awful (as in they will make your eyes bleed), very unpolished in general, no sound, 1 player mode lacks AI and networking is pretty much work in progress


controls
--------

first player: arrows + keypad 0
second player: wasd + space
